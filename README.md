# Jayven Lupera's GitHub Portfolio 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of the Philippines Visayas making my digital print, one line of code at a time.  This repository showcases various projects I‚Äôve worked on, ranging from web scraping, and machine learning, data analysis, to full-stack development during and after my studies. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!

## Projects

### [Go UP](https://github.com/jbeninjaa/GoUp)
  - Go is a 2D platformer and infinite vertical scroller where players ascend using a projectile launcher. The difficulty increases with challenges like moving platforms, spawning enemies, and physics-based puzzles as they progress. Players score points by climbing higher, avoiding collision damage. The game features permadeath, meaning all progress is lost upon death, requiring players to start over from the beginning each time.

### [Rescue Pets](https://github.com/jbeninjaa/Rescue-Pets)
  - A gamification-based animal rescue system for Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center
Developed a web application system for an animal rehabilitation and rescue center to provide better engagement by implementing a gamification feature which is a virtual pet that interacts with the transactions of the user. Allows the user to create an account and log in using Google‚Äôs federated authentication for convenience, gamification is applied in the system by recording the engagement of the user with the system by the use of virtual points. Every transaction made by the user has equivalent virtual points that enable the user‚Äôs virtual pets to level up.
